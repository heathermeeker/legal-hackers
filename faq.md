## Frequently asked questions

(Send your questions as a patch to this FAQ! I'll review it, merge it, and
respond by commit with the answer.)

### Why did you start this project?

The idea of a private list similar to this came up in discussion. I decided to
convert it to a public version and make it more maintainable and accessible by
hosting it with `git`.

### How do I contribute to the project if I don't know `git`?

I'd recommending searching a bit to try and learn a bit online. It shouldn't
take too long, plus it's an invaluable skill which you can hopefully use
elsewhere! Try sending a patch, and if you don't succeed, we'll be happy to help
you! There's no shaming here.

### You didn't answer my question, or I have a question!

It's best to ask on [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#legal-hackers)
to see if someone can help you. Once we get a big enough community going, we'll
add a mailing list. If you don't get any response from the above, you can
contact me through my [website](https://purpleidea.com/contact/) and I'll do my
best to help. If you have a good question, please add it as a patch to this
documentation. I'll merge your question, and add a patch with the answer!
